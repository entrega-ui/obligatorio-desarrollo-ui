## Running Project 
- Go to your project's root folder and run `npm install`.
- Create a `.env` file to store all your configuration constants. Remember to not commit this file, since it can store sensible information of your product.
- Run `npm run ios` or `npm run android` to start your application!

## Folder structure
This template follows a very simple project structure:
- `src`: This folder is the main container of all the code inside your application.
  - `actions`: This folder contains all actions that can be dispatched to redux.
  - `assets`: Asset folder to store all images, vectors, etc.
  - `components`: Folder to store any common component that you use through your app (such as a generic button)
  - `constants`: Folder to store any kind of constant that you have.
  - `controllers`: Folder to store all your network logic (you should have one controller per resource).
  - `localization`: Folder to store the languages files.
  - `navigation`: Folder to store the navigators.
  - `reducers`: This folder should have all your reducers, and expose the combined result using its `index.js`
  - `screens`: Folder that contains all your application screens/features.
      - `Screen`: Each screen should be stored inside it's own folder, and inside it a file for its code and a separate one for the styles and tests. Then, the `index.js` is only used to export the final component that will be used on the app.
        - `Screen.js`
        - `Screen.styles.js`
        - `Screen.test.js`
        - `index.js`
  - `selectors`: Folder to store your selectors for each reducer.
  - `storage`: Folder that contains the application storage logic.
  - `store`: Folder to put all redux middlewares and the store.
  - `theme`: Folder to store all the styling concerns related to the application theme.
  - `App.js`: Main component that starts your whole app.
- `index.js`: Entry point of your application as per React-Native standards.

## Styleguide
For coding styling we decided to go with ESLint and [React Native community's styleguide](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-react-native-community#readme).
